# hello-world
This is just me getting used to GitHub

Hey I'm Jamie! I started coding a little over a year ago when I started uni. 
I originally had no idea what I wanted to study but though that computing 
sounded interesting and different, and now I absolutely love the challenge it
provides but also the ability to make something from nothing more than my
laptop.
